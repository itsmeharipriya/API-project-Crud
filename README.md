# Postman CRUD API Testing Project

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates API testing using **Postman** for performing **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on REST APIs.  
It covers request validation, authentication handling, data-driven testing, and automated execution using the Postman Collection Runner.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Postman
- REST API
- JSON
- CSV (for data-driven testing)
- GitHub (version control)

---

## Authentication
- Token-based authentication is implemented.
- Token is generated from the **Login API** and stored as an environment variable.
- The token is reused across all secured APIs using the `Authorization` header.
